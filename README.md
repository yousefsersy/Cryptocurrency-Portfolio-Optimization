# Cryptocurrency Portfolio Optimization with Unsupervised Learning

# Project Overview
This project involves creating a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios based on cryptocurrencies. I proposed a strategy that goes beyond traditional metrics like returns and volatility. By incorporating additional factors that might impact the crypto market, this approach aims to enhance portfolio performance.

To showcase this idea, I developed a prototype using Python programming skills and unsupervised learning techniques. The prototype clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance over different periods and visualizes the results to facilitate decision-making by the board of directors.
